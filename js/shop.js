      "The number that actually matters isn't your system's average draw, it's the transient spike: a graphics card under load can briefly pull two to three times its rated power for a few milliseconds. A supply with too little headroom won't smoothly reduce performance when that happens — it will trip its protection circuit and cut power entirely, which looks exactly like a random crash and is genuinely difficult to diagnose after the fact.",
      "Our own rule of thumb, and the one baked into the compatibility checks on every product page here: take the GPU manufacturer's recommended wattage, and don't go below it even if a calculator suggests you could. If you're planning to keep the system for years and might upgrade the graphics card later, buying one tier above that recommendation costs relatively little now and saves a full PSU swap later.",
      "The other number worth checking is the connector, not just the wattage. Modern high-end cards increasingly use the 12V-2×6 connector rather than multiple 8-pin PCIe leads, and a supply's wattage rating tells you nothing about which connectors it actually has in the box."

      "Memory listings lead with a big speed number — 6000, 6400, sometimes higher — and bury the latency rating in smaller text below it. That ordering is backwards for most buyers, because at a given speed, latency is usually the bigger lever on real performance.",
      "CL30 and CL36 kits running at the same 6000 MT/s aren't interchangeable. The lower CAS latency number means fewer clock cycles between a memory request and the data arriving, and across the range of workloads we actually test on our bench — game frame times, compression, code compilation — a CL30 kit consistently edges out a CL36 kit at the same speed, sometimes by a margin that matters and sometimes by one that doesn't.",
      "Where it matters most: anything sensitive to memory latency rather than bandwidth, which in practice means gaming frame times and any single-threaded workload. Where it matters least: sustained throughput tasks like video encoding, which lean more on raw bandwidth than latency.",
      "Practically: if a CL30 and a CL36 kit at the same speed are priced close together, take the CL30 kit. If the latency upgrade costs meaningfully more, it's only worth it if you're specifically chasing 1% lows in games or working with latency-sensitive software."

Modern OLED panels ship with pixel-shifting and logo-dimming safeguards, and the failure case — a taskbar or a static UI element left on screen for extended, uninterrupted periods — is avoidable with basic habits rather than a reason to avoid the panel entirely.",
      "Where a fast IPS panel still wins outright: pure text work at small font sizes. OLED's subpixel layout can produce faint colour fringing on fine text that some people never notice and others find genuinely uncomfortable during long reading or coding sessions. If your desk is 80% spreadsheets and code with gaming in the evenings, test an OLED panel in person before committing.",
      "Our honest recommendation: if gaming is the primary use, OLED's response time and contrast are worth the burn-in caveat. If the monitor spends most of its life showing a code editor or a browser, a high-refresh IPS panel remains the safer everyday choice."

It makes less sense for the newest graphics card generation, where refurbished stock is scarce and the discount versus new is usually small.",
